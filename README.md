# Tribute
A project I created for a **Free Code Camp course**. I made some changes and put it as a tribute to an artist I like, I tried to adapt the design and make it as responsive as possible.

On this site I tried to make a very subtle adaptation to the mediaquery, and focused on leaving it with a simple, yet beautiful design.

I also installed the [blond](https://www.reddit.com/r/identifythisfont/comments/chkorg/what_font_does_frank_ocean_use_on_his_blond_album/) _font_ and used some _fonts_ from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
And the _Free Code Camp_ course is: [Responsive Web Design](www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-the-css-box-model-by-building-a-rothko-painting)
